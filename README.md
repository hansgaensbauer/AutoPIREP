AutoPIREP is a website, backend, and IOS app for automatically reporting turbulence in General Aviation flights. Traditionally, a pilot is expected to radio air traffic control to submit a Pilot Report (PIREP) when they encounter turbulence. The IOS app presented here uses the accelerometer in an iPhone to detect turbulence, and then submits reports to a custom backend running in AWS. The website displays the reports on a map for other pilots to reference.
