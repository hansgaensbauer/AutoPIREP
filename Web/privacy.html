        <h1>AutoPIREP Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Effective Date: July 14 2024</h2>
        <p>
            Thank you for choosing to use the AutoPIREP app. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information 
            when you use our app. By using AutoPIREP, you agree to the terms of this policy.
            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            We collect accelerometer and geolocation data from your phone to detect turbulence. Location data is stored as a 5 digit geohash, 
            meaning it can be used to approximate your location to within a square with a side length of about 4.89 kilometers depending on 
            your latitude. Accelerometer data is used to detect turbulence, and is stored only as a number from 1-5 representing the severity
            of the detected turbulence.

            <h3>2. Use of Information</h3>
            The information we collect is used for the following purposes:

            <ul>
                <li>To create pilot reports based on sensor data</li>
                <li>To plot alerts on a publicly available map at https://www.autopirep.com</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            We do not store any identifiable information about the user. Location data is stored as a geohash with low precision (5 digits), 
            which anonymizes the exact location.

            <h3>4. Sharing of Information</h3>
            We do not share, sell, or distribute your information to third parties. The location data and turbulence severity plotted on the 
            publicly available map is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual users.

            <h3>5. User Control</h3>
            You have control over the data you provide. If you choose not to share your location or sensor data, certain features of the app 
            may not function as intended. 

            <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this 
            page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

            <h3>7. Contact Us</h3>
            If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at autopirep@gmail.com.
